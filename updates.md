Dear Developer,

Thank you for implementing the Crypto Pulse dashboard. The current version provides valuable real-time data for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), and the S&P 500 ('GSPC), along with a Fear & Greed Index. However, to make informed trading decisions for SPX and BTC, several critical elements are missing. Below, I’ve outlined these gaps and provided instructions to address them, including how to source free data for the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) and 10-Year Treasury Yield (US10Y), which are currently using placeholder data.

What’s Missing to Make Informed Decisions
Real-Time DXY and US10Y Data
Issue: The dashboard uses placeholder data for the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) and 10-Year Treasury Yield (US10Y), limiting macro context for SPX and BTC trading decisions. These metrics are crucial for understanding currency strength and interest rate impacts on market correlation and volatility.
Solution: Integrate real-time or near-real-time free data feeds for DXY and US10Y to reflect current macroeconomic conditions accurately.
Intraday Correlation Metrics
Issue: The dashboard lacks short-term (e.g., 5-minute, 15-minute, 1-hour) rolling correlation data between BTC, SPX, and SPY. This is essential for scalping strategies, as daily data alone doesn’t capture rapid market shifts.
Solution: Add a correlation panel showing 1-hour rolling correlations for BTC vs. SPX and BTC vs. SPY, updated every 5 minutes.
Volatility Indicators
Issue: There’s no intraday volatility data (e.g., Average True Range [ATR] or volatility-of-volatility) to identify breakout opportunities for scalping SPX and BTC.
Solution: Include a volatility widget displaying 1-hour ATR for BTC and SPX, refreshed every 15 minutes, alongside a volatility spike alert when ATR exceeds the 20-day average by 1.5x.
Liquidity and Order Book Insights
Issue: Missing data on BTC funding rates, open interest, or SPX e-mini futures volume clusters limits understanding of liquidity and potential price traps.
Solution: Add a liquidity tab with BTC perpetual funding rates (from sources like Coinglass) and SPX futures volume heatmap, updated hourly.
Trading Signal Framework
Issue: The dashboard lacks actionable trading rules or a signal matrix based on correlation, volatility, and macro conditions (e.g., VIX, DXY, US10Y).
Solution: Implement a signal matrix panel, e.g.:

VIX	BTC Vol (ATR)	BTC/SPX Corr	DXY Trend	Signal
<20	High	>0.6	Falling	Scalp Long BTC
>25	High	>0.6	Rising	Hedge or Avoid
Update this every 15 minutes with real-time inputs.				
Historical Backtest Results
Issue: No historical performance data for trading strategies (e.g., win rates during correlation >0.7) to validate decision-making.
Solution: Add a backtest section with a table of simulated trades (e.g., win rate, profit factor) for the past 90 days, based on correlation and volatility triggers.
Forward-Looking Forecast
Issue: Missing short-term probability forecasts (e.g., next 30-day BTC/SPX correlation trend) to guide proactive trading.
Solution: Include a forecast box with a 70% confidence interval for BTC/SPX correlation and expected volatility spikes, updated daily based on macro events (e.g., FOMC).
Instructions for Fetching Free DXY and 10-Year Treasury Data
To replace the placeholder data with reliable free sources, follow these steps:

1. U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) Data
Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) – Provided by the St. Louis Fed.
URL: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DTWEXBGS9
Description: Offers the Broad Dollar Index (DTWEXBGS9), a close proxy for DXY, updated daily with historical data.
Implementation:
Use the FRED API (free with registration at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html) to fetch DXY data.
Register for an API key and include it in your request (e.g., https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=DTWEXBGS9&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&file_type=json).
Parse the JSON response to extract the latest value and 24-hour change.
Set up a cron job or similar scheduler to poll the API every 15 minutes for near-real-time updates (FRED updates daily, but intraday approximations can be derived from forex platforms).
Fallback: If API latency is an issue, supplement with Yahoo Finance (e.g., ^USD) via yfinance Python library, though data may lag slightly.
2. 10-Year Treasury Yield (US10Y) Data
Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury – Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates.
URL: https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value_month=202505
Description: Provides the 10-Year Treasury Note yield, updated daily at 4:00 PM ET.
Implementation:
Scrape the webpage or use the Treasury’s API (https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financing-the-government/interest-rate-statistics) with a free tier (requires registration).
Extract the latest 10-Year yield value and calculate the 24-hour change based on the previous day’s data.
Automate data retrieval with a script (e.g., Python with requests and BeautifulSoup) to run every 15 minutes, interpolating intraday changes from forex or bond market feeds (e.g., TradingView).
Fallback: Use Yahoo Finance (^TNX) via yfinance for real-time approximations, though accuracy may vary outside official updates.
General Notes
Rate Limiting: Both FRED and Treasury APIs have usage limits (e.g., 1,000 requests/day for FRED). Optimize by caching data locally and updating only when new values are available.
Data Validation: Cross-check DXY and US10Y with secondary sources (e.g., Investing.com) to ensure consistency.
Integration: Update the dashboard’s UI to reflect “Fresh” status once real-time data is integrated, removing the placeholder notice.
Next Steps
Priority: Focus on integrating DXY and US10Y data first, as these are critical for macro-informed decisions.
Timeline: Aim to deploy real-time DXY/US10Y feeds by end of day May 22, 2025, followed by correlation and volatility enhancements by May 25, 2025.
Testing: Validate data accuracy with a 24-hour trial run, comparing dashboard values against manual checks from FRED and Treasury sites.
Please implement these changes and let me know if you need assistance with code snippets or API setup. Once these are in place, we can refine the dashboard further based on user feedback.
