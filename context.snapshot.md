- Summary: Initialized persistent memory tracking by creating `context.snapshot.md`. Added this snapshot file to the memory section of `AGENTS.md` so future agents append updates. Summarized the repository's status after early cleanup and completion of tasks up to 31. Documentation tasks starting at 62 remain pending. This foundation ensures continuity for upcoming work.
- Next Goal: Generate API reference documentation for existing modules.
