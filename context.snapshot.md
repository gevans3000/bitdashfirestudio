- Summary: Introduced CODEX_START.md to outline kickoff and memory workflow and removed the outdated PERSISTENT_MEMORY_GUIDE. Updated AGENTS.md so each task commit also appends a memory block to context.snapshot.md.
- Next Goal: Ensure scripts and docs consistently reference CODEX_START for future automation.
