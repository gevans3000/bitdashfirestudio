## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   
   You'll need to obtain API keys for:
   - [FRED API](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html) (required for DXY and Treasury data)
   - [Financial Modeling Prep](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer) (required as fallback data source)

3. Install dependencies and start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Data Sources & Reliability

BitDash Firestudio uses multiple data sources to ensure accuracy and reliability:

### US Dollar Index (DXY)
- **Primary Source**: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
- **Fallback**: Financial Modeling Prep
- **Validation**: Values are checked against expected ranges (70-120)
- **Update Frequency**: Every 5 minutes

### US 10-Year Treasury Yield
- **Primary Source**: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
- **Fallback**: Financial Modeling Prep
- **Validation**: Values are checked for reasonableness (0-20%)
- **Update Frequency**: Every 5 minutes

### Data Quality Indicators
Each data point includes a quality indicator:
- ðŸŸ¢ **High Confidence**: Data from primary source within expected range
- ðŸ”µ **Good**: Data from fallback source within expected range
- ðŸŸ¡ **Fair**: Data outside normal range but still valid
- ðŸ”´ **Error**: Unable to fetch valid data from any source
