# Agent Guidelines

- **Read `TASKS.md` before coding** to understand current priorities.
- **Make incremental changes**, committing after each small edit.
- **Use conventional commit messages** following the guidelines in `TASKS.md` (type, scope, description, etc.).
- **Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` before every commit**. If a `test` script exists, also run `npm test`.
- **Place tests** in `tests/` or `__tests__/` and use Node's built-in `node:test` or minimal frameworks.
- **Keep dependencies minimal** and follow the simplicity rules in `.windsurfrules` for a modern UI and clean codebase.
- **Resolve merge conflicts promptly**, ensuring these guidelines remain intact.
