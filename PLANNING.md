## Architecture
- **Frontend**: NextJS 14+ with App Router
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions)
- **AI/ML**: Custom models for market prediction
- **Data**: Real-time market data from multiple financial APIs
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui for responsive design

## Key Components
1. **Market Data Pipeline** - Real-time price and volume data
2. **AI Analysis Engine** - Signal generation and prediction models
3. **User Dashboard** - Personalized trading insights
4. **Alert System** - Custom notifications for trading opportunities
5. **Portfolio Tracking** - Performance monitoring and analytics
4. **UI Components** - Reusable, accessible components
5. **API Routes** - Serverless functions for backend logic

```

## Development Workflow
1. **Local Development**
   - Run `npm run dev` for development server
   - Environment variables in `.env.local`
   - Automatic hot reloading

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests with Jest
   - Component tests with React Testing Library
   - E2E tests with Cypress

3. **Deployment**
   - Automatic builds on push to main
   - Firebase Hosting for web app
   - Firebase Functions for serverless backend

## Authentication Flow
1. User signs in with email/password or Google OAuth
2. Session managed by Firebase Auth
3. Protected routes check authentication status
4. User data stored in Firestore

## Data Management
- Firestore for real-time data
- Client-side data fetching with React Query
- Server-side rendering for SEO-critical pages
- Optimistic UI updates

## Performance Optimization
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Image optimization with Next/Image
- Static generation for marketing pages
- API route caching

## Security
- Firebase Security Rules
- Input validation on API routes
