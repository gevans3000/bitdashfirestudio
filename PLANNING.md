# BitDash Firestudio - Planning

Last Updated: 2025-05-21

## Project Overview
BitDash Firestudio is a NextJS starter project with Firebase integration, designed for rapid web application development with a focus on performance and developer experience.

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Environment:** Development

## Architecture
- NextJS 14+ with App Router
- Firebase Integration
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn/ui components

## Key Components
1. **Authentication** - User management with Firebase Auth
2. **Database** - Firestore for real-time data
3. **Storage** - Firebase Storage for file uploads
4. **UI Components** - Reusable, accessible components
5. **API Routes** - Serverless functions for backend logic

## File Structure
```

├── app/                    # App router pages and layouts
├── components/             # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/                 # Shadcn/ui components
│   └── shared/             # Custom shared components
├── lib/                    # Utility functions and configs
│   └── firebase/           # Firebase configuration
├── public/                 # Static assets
├── styles/                 # Global styles
├── types/                  # TypeScript type definitions
└── .env.local              # Environment variables
```

## Development Workflow
1. **Local Development**
   - Run `npm run dev` for development server
   - Environment variables in `.env.local`
   - Automatic hot reloading

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests with Jest
   - Component tests with React Testing Library
   - E2E tests with Cypress

3. **Deployment**
   - Automatic builds on push to main
   - Firebase Hosting for web app
   - Firebase Functions for serverless backend

## Authentication Flow
1. User signs in with email/password or Google OAuth
2. Session managed by Firebase Auth
3. Protected routes check authentication status
4. User data stored in Firestore

## Data Management
- Firestore for real-time data
- Client-side data fetching with React Query
- Server-side rendering for SEO-critical pages
- Optimistic UI updates

## Performance Optimization
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Image optimization with Next/Image
- Static generation for marketing pages
- API route caching

## Security
- Firebase Security Rules
- Input validation on API routes
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

## Monitoring
- Firebase Analytics
- Error tracking with Sentry
- Performance monitoring
- Custom logging

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement user roles and permissions
- [ ] Add offline support with service workers
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add internationalization (i18n)

## Dependencies
- Next.js 14+
- React 18+
- Firebase 10+
- TypeScript 5+
- Tailwind CSS 3+
- Shadcn/ui components
