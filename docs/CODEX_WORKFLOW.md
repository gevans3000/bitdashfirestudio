# Codex Workflow Guide

This document distills the key points from `CODEX-INSTRUCTIONS.txt` for working with this repository using the Codex agent.

## Commit-Based Memory

- Each task in `TASKS.md` should be completed in a single commit.
- Prefix commit messages with `Task <number>:` followed by a short summary.
- Keep the subject line around 50 characters; wrap body lines near 72 characters.
- Commit history acts as long-term memory for the agent. Review recent commits before starting a new session.
- Run `npm ci` once at the start of a session. Subsequent commits can reuse the installed `node_modules`.

## Keeping the Workspace Alive

Codex runs in an ephemeral container. To avoid losing context:

1. Queue multiple subtasks in one card and keep the card open.
2. Avoid closing the task panel between commits.
3. Use a long-lived branch if working on a larger feature.
4. Optionally create a small keep-alive script (e.g., `touch KEEPALIVE`) to prevent idle shutdown.

### Recommended Prompt Pattern

```
We will complete Tasks Xâ€“Y in one session.
1. Run `npm ci` once.
2. Work through each task sequentially, committing after each.
Keep this workspace running until I say "close workspace".
```

## Commit Log Utility

A helper script `scripts/commit-log.js` is provided to generate `logs/commit.log` with the latest commit messages:

```bash
npm run commitlog
```

Use this log to quickly review recent work when resuming the project.
