# Memory Log

This file records a running history of completed tasks and key decisions. After every commit append a line with:

```
<hash> | Task <id> | <summary> | <files>
```

Include the timestamp and keep the summary under 333 tokens. The Git log plus this file rebuild context when sessions restart.
