# Memory Log

This file records a running history of completed tasks and key decisions. After each commit, append the 333-token summary along with the commit hash, timestamp and list of changed files. Git commit messages mirror these entries so the log acts as persistent memory. Use it alongside `context.snapshot.md` to rebuild context between sessions or recover after interruptions.
